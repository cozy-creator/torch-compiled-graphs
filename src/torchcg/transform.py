"""Transform passes: what MAKES a lane's format (tcg#52).

torchcg observes author code; it does not rewrite it. A transform pass is not
a counter-example to that -- it is the thing that produces the FORMAT a lane
declares. ``Lane`` already means "the tensor-layout contract this lane expects
checkpoints in"; an fp8 lane's weights are fp8 because something converted
them, and a precompute lane's blocks hold a side table because something
folded them. A pass gives that "something" a name, a version, an identity and
an artifact. The author's own code still runs untouched over the result.

**Ordering is PASS -> DISCOVERY -> EXPORT, and it is structural.** The graph
that gets identity must be the graph that serves, so:

* a pass runs inside a :class:`TransformSession`, which ``seal()``s ONCE; a
  ``run`` after the seal is refused;
* :func:`seal_for_export` stamps every module discovery or adoption touches,
  and :meth:`TransformSession.run` refuses a target holding a stamped
  submodule -- a pass after export is refused from the other side too;
* the sealed :class:`TransformSet` is what ``discover_modules`` accepts as
  evidence, it is a derivation input of ``cg-graph-v1`` (exactly as pins
  are -- two lanes differing only by a pass are DIFFERENT graphs), and
  ``AdoptSession`` refuses a boot whose ran-pass set does not equal the set
  the document's lane declares.

**The side table is NON-PERSISTENT BUFFERS, not a dict.** ie#615 measured the
dict version's failure mode: ``transformer.to("cuda")`` moved every parameter
and left the plain-dict cache on the host, and the first cuda denoise died
"Expected all tensors to be on the same device". The endpoint patched it with
an ``_apply`` override -- one override, in one module, that every future
side-table module would have to remember. Registering the table as buffers
kills the bug class instead: ``nn.Module._apply`` moves them because they ARE
module state, and ``torch.export`` LIFTS them as named inputs the arm binds by
name (tcg#42's static lifted inputs) rather than baking half a gigabyte of
constants into the ``.so``. ``persistent=False`` keeps them out of
``state_dict()``, so the lane contract's weight names are untouched.
