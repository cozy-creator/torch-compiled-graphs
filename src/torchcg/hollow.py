"""Weights-free pipeline instantiation for the publish-time derive (pgw#1370).

The 2026-08-18 ruling puts the derive at PUBLISH time, on CPU, inside the
release env, against CONFIG-ONLY checkpoint subsets -- never weights. Author
code still calls ``from_pretrained(...).to("cuda")`` as-is, so this module
supplies the session that makes that code run hollow:

* **Loader interception** -- ``diffusers.ModelMixin.from_pretrained`` and
  ``transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`` are replaced for the
  session: the component is built from its CONFIG (parameters born on meta,
  buffers computed real -- they are pure functions of config and are what a
  literal digest reads), then every parameter becomes a FAKE tensor in the
  session's one ``FakeTensorMode``. Tokenizers, schedulers and processors
  load real from the config-only tree; they never carry weights.
* **Two devices, named honestly** (tcg#64) -- the STATED trace device, which
  the graphs are stamped with, and the DRIVE device, where the run's real
  tensors actually live. They are the same device whenever this host can hold
  a real tensor there, and they differ on exactly one shape: a GPU-less box
  stating ``cuda``.

  Splitting them is what makes a normal trace just work. The stated device
  used to be forced onto the drive as well, so a GPU-less ``cuda`` derive had
  to fake every real tensor the author's code touched -- and a full diffusers
  pipeline does not survive that: ``encode_prompt`` moves real token ids to
  the execution device, the scheduler reads real sigmas with ``.item()``, and
  fakifying them either runs a real cuda kernel on a box with no GPU or trips
  fake-tensor data-dependence. The drive now runs on a device that EXISTS, so
  every one of those reads gets its real value, exactly as it does on a GPU.

  It costs nothing in identity because the drive does not decide identity.
  Discovery is two passes: the drive only records each marked module's call
  STRUCTURE (dtype and shape), and the graph is produced by a second,
  independent ``torch.export`` of that module alone. So the drive's device
  reaches the graph through one channel only -- the device stamped into the
  exported program -- and :func:`restate_program` restates it afterwards.
  Measured line-for-line: a cpu export restated onto cuda is byte-identical
  to a native fake-cuda export, and a GPU-less sd1.5 derive reproduces the
  graph keys of the GPU-traced one.

  The stated device is still a REAL decision (pgw#1458): it is stamped into
  every node's meta and therefore into the graph's identity, and a mint for a
  different class refuses by name (``RuntimeCompatibility.key``). What is
  gone is the HOST deciding it -- ``cuda`` needs no silicon.

  What was never device is the ARCH. Device (``cpu`` vs ``cuda``) is not arch
  (``sm_86`` vs ``sm_90``): one cuda trace serves every ``sm``, because the sm
  enters at ARTIFACT level through ``RuntimeCompatibility``.

  Device uniformity must be TOTAL on the stated side. Parameters, buffers AND
  lifted tensor constants all carry the stated device; leaving any one
  real-on-cpu yields a MIXED ``['cpu','cuda:0']`` placement that exports
  cleanly and only AOTI rejects.
* **Fake egress** -- scalarization of a fake tensor (``.numpy()``,
  ``.item()``, ``.tolist()``, ``bool()``) answers canonical ZEROS instead of
  refusing. Observation is structure-only; a value-dependent branch in author
  code follows the zero surrogate path, which costs coverage on that branch,
  never correctness of an observed graph. Real tensors (schedulers, token
  ids) are untouched -- the whole-pipeline ambient-fake drive was measured
  non-viable precisely because scheduler ``.item()`` needs real values.

The session deliberately does NOT wrap the run in an ambient
``FakeTensorMode``: only tensors DERIVED from hollow parameters are fake, so
the author's control flow keeps its real values.
