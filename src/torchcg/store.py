"""The abstract compiled-graph store, and its local-CAS implementation.

torchcg owns the compile LIFECYCLE; it knows nothing about hubs, JWTs,
releases or pods (tcg#41). Everything the lifecycle needs from persistence is
this interface: graph-set documents by name, artifacts positioned by
(graph, env), requirements manifests beside them, and hole listing. gen-worker
implements it hub-backed; cozy-local implements it over a bare local CAS;
``LocalGraphStore`` here is both the reference implementation and the
lifecycle test double -- same lifecycle code, any store.

Addresses live under ``torchcg/v2`` -- a NEW address space for the two-level
identity scheme. ``torchcg/v1`` (exact cg-key rows, ``storage.py``) is the
prior grammar; nothing reads both.

## A graph-set document this build cannot read is ABSENT, and it is discarded

tcg#69. Every byte in this store is DERIVED: a graph-set document is a
statement about programs that can be re-traced and artifacts that can be
re-minted from sources the store does not own. So a document written by an
older ``DOCUMENT_FORMAT`` is not a fault to report, it is a document this
build does not have -- ``get_graphs`` returns ``None``, the caller registers
holes and serves eager while a background mint refills, and the unreadable
bytes are dropped. That is the SAME path a store with no document at all
takes, which is what makes it safe: the miss branch is the one every caller
already exercises on a fresh box.

There is NO migration machinery here and there never will be (Paul,
2026-08-19: *"weights migrate/normalize once at ingest; graphs regenerate"*).
A format bump costs one re-mint, and code that translates old graph documents
would be a permanent tax paid to avoid a one-time cost that the store is
designed to absorb.

What this replaces: raising ``StoreError`` at ADOPT time. It was typed and
loud, so it was never silent -- but it landed on every local user's first
cold start after an upgrade, at serving time, on a machine that could simply
have rebuilt. The condition was diagnosed correctly and handled at the wrong
altitude.
