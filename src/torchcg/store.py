"""Where the artifact lives: content-addressed get/put over one tensorfs CAS.

An artifact is a compressed tarball, so it enters the store as one whole
unchunked blob named by the sha256 of its bytes, and an exact-key ref points
straight at it. There is no per-artifact manifest: a manifest holding exactly
one file entry is an indirection with nothing to describe.

**Mint-once, first-writer-wins. The KEY is the identity; the bytes are not.**
(tcg#84, ruled 2026-08-21.) A second write under an existing key is refused
OUTRIGHT -- the store never compares the incoming bytes with the stored ones,
because that comparison cannot mean what it looks like it means: AOTI does not
emit the same bytes twice for one graph on one host under one env and policy
(measured here, two mints, everything else held), so a byte difference is not
evidence of a key collision and a byte match is not evidence of its absence.
A verdict a check cannot prove is worse than no check, because it will be
believed.

Identity integrity therefore lives entirely in the key derivation -- graph
witness x env x layout x policy -- whose stability is what the checked-in hash
bank actually measures.

The artifact's content digest survives for exactly one job: TRANSPORT
INTEGRITY. It answers "did these bytes arrive intact", never "is this the right
artifact".
