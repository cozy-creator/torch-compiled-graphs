"""Split AOTI's generated wrapper constructor so g++ stops paying a
superlinear price for a data table written as code.

Measured, per host invocation: an AOTI mint's entire host cost is ONE
``g++ -O1 -c wrapper.cpp`` — 180.6 s of a 390 s AOTI compile (46%); linking is
2.0 s (0.5%), so every classic build lever (mold/lld, ccache, PCH, parallel
host builds) is measured null or already exhausted. That one
translation unit is 6.3 MB / 61k lines and is dominated by TWO functions,
the larger of which is ``AOTInductorModel::AOTInductorModel`` — 26,642
``constants_info_[i].field = ...;`` statements (2,422 constants x 11
fields). It is a DATA TABLE spelled as straight-line executable code, it
runs exactly once at model construction, and it has no runtime significance
whatsoever. GCC's optimizer is superlinear in statements WITHIN one
function, so this is a single-function blowup, not a big-file problem.

This module rewrites that one run of statements into chunked helper
functions before the compiler sees it. Nothing else in the TU is touched;
``run_impl`` — which does carry runtime significance — is left exactly as
inductor emitted it.

Why a mint-path transform and not an inductor config: torch 2.13 exposes no
knob for constants emission or per-function optimization, and the only
config that moves this cost (``compile_wrapper_opt_level='O0'``) is DEAD —
measured at +1.7% per forward, which exceeds AOT's whole 1.4% serving margin,
and it also re-keys every compiled graph. This transform re-keys nothing (see
:func:`install`).

FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. The transform only ever fires when it can
prove, by textual reconstruction, that it is a pure statement-preserving
regrouping: :func:`split_constants_constructor` re-inlines its own output
and refuses unless the reconstruction is byte-identical to the input. Any
wrapper shape it does not recognise compiles unmodified. A silent no-op is
correct; a mangled TU is not.
